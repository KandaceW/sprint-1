# My Reflections - Sprint One 

So far this week I can tell you that I have reflected and reflected and reflected, I have spent sooooo many hourts going in circles.

The parts I have struggled with are..... Everything!
I have and am learning so much yet I have not completed much I fear! 

I have learnt all about Github, repositories, Cloning merging, pullling, and all aspects of sprint-1 has been completky new so everything is ne learning.

keeping a time log has been interesting I have to admint I struggle to focus on a particular task its def getting my brain to try and start to focus more and its exactly what I want and neewd in my life!

Im not confident in the learning competency I desperatly need so help tbh! haha are we alowed to use that text slang in our reflections? hehe
i seem to not be able to get my user right and then password wrong but the i see I have made a comit and I just dont understand it all!

My strategies are fairly unclear I have no real idea how to aproach any of it and end up with good results. 
It seems that when I follow the instructions it goes wrong, I ask for help I been get it wrong, I just don't really have a strategy I find is working.
I really really am worried I am not able to do this I thought this is sposed to be the basics and I just can't even make it work or if i do I dont know how i did! I am easily confused untill I am shown then I tend to be all good!
i feel like there are copies n copies of things. I'm not really good at working out of terminal yet. My speed on everything is way behind although I have probably spent Shitloads more than 40 hours on this.
I will be doing a reflection on and on all of the Learning competencies and things today so that you can see there I have tried and that might be little bit easieror make it clearer for myself aswell.
I apologise I haven't keept a log totally I have tried to keep time with toggle and I've tried really hard to keep snapshots of my leaning along the way. 
I'm writing this right now by using dictation methods in text edit and I'm copying and pasting it into May workspace because I have way to much to type and not enough time to type it he he..... Atleast this statergy works for me!

I can do dictation straight into my workspace what a find of course again so even easier again!

I have to say that I've enjoyed it as well as finding it extremely stressful the tedious parts are mainly just trying to remember to keep track of everything to just keep focused.
its tedious because I'm so not wired like that its probly my biggest issue with completing or understanding of this!







In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions in your reflection:

* What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
* Which parts of the work did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the work did you find tedious?
